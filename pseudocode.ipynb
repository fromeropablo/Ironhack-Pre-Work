    "Pseudo-code is an informal coding practice to help programmers plan algorithms and train programmatic thinking. Pseudo-code is not tied to any specific programming language such as Python, JavaScript, or C#. Instead, it uses human languages. By using pseudo-code, you can plan every step of your program without worrying about syntax. Its greatest benefit is to allow you to discover the vulnerabilities and opportunities of your programmatic logic in order to improve it before implementation."
